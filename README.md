# GUI-in-Python
This project is a GUI-based Python application built with Tkinter, offering two interactive functionalities.
The first program calculates the largest prime factor of a given number, providing an intuitive interface for input and result display.
The second program enables users to perform operations on sets and tuples, such as adding, deleting, updating, or displaying elements.
With clearly labeled buttons, dropdown menus, and dedicated result frames, the application is user-friendly and visually appealing. 
It's designed to showcase basic mathematical problem-solving and data structure manipulation in Python, making it a great example of integrating functionality with GUI development for beginners.
The image used in the GUI is also present in the repository.
